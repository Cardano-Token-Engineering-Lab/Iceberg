# External Research

The concept for developing and building out Iceberg is nothing new in the blockhain world.  There already exists a variety of solutions supporting various blockchains to help extract data for developing insights around on-chain activities.  There are primarily 3 types of projects that employ data analytics and research leveraging on-chain data.  The aim of Iceberg is to fall in the first group being open sourced to enable free access to data.

1. ### ***Open Source (Free and Tier-based Subscription Model)***
   
   Projects such as Dune and Flipside Crypto are the two most commonly known ones that allow users the ability to query and develop visualizations and insights on their platforms.  The power behind these models are that users can grow with the platform and highlight their data analytic skills which are highly sought after by both investors and projects.  Understanding trends and what is happening on chain, enables them to develop alpha into how the markets and trends are shaping.  
   
   Since these projects are opensource and designed as open-ended projects, they do require some low level understanding of some base language like SQL or Python to pull and develop insights.  An interesting set of tools that have been built on the EVM are the suite of tools developed by Storm from Paradigm: mesc, cryo, spice and tbl.  The tools are designed to help manage RPC endpoints, query data using python from RPC endpoints or Dune, and also manage and manipulate data.  This is all done through a simple CLI tool and all are completely free and open source (although data acceess through endpoints may incur costs).

2. ### ***Closed Source (Full Subscription Model)***
   
   Projects like Delphi Digital, Blockworks Research, and Messari offer a full suite of analytic tools, but they come at a premium.  In addition to access to their data and insights, they have a full team of analysts who develop narratives around onchain activities and help provide a curated take of what is happening.  There are some reports and data that is shown for free, but largely their data and insights platform is hidden behind a paywall which is quite pricey for the hobbyist and largely is designed at professionals in the crypto space.
   
   The beauty of these type of platforms is that the most of the data is not presented in a raw format and shown in curated views, graphics, and plots.  There are some tabular datasets that are available, but it is largely designed around themes and narratives to which analysts who are experts in those areas (ie DeFi, SocialFi, Infra, etc..) do exhaustive research on said topics.

3. ### ***Private Platforms (Institutional and Project-based)***
   
   Many large VC firms, Market Makers and/or projects run their own private data infrastructure to enable them to manage trading, liquidity management, and/or research projects that they are either involved in and/or have interest in.  Many firms acknowledge that they have inhouse data engineering teams and analyst supporting them and build out professional grade platforms to support their operations.  A good example of this would be Coinbase Institutional, Wintermute, Blackrock's Crypto wing (formerly known as Onyx) and a variety of VC firms and investment companies.
